    "content": "Alhamdulillah, I just landed my first job at Gateway ICT Solutions as a Frontend Web Developer. I started applying through Linkedin hoping that I could get a job to add some value to a company and gain some experience. I got messages and replies from most of the companies that I applied for. But unfortunately, I couldn't get the job because they were not remote jobs. One day, I received a reply from a senior developer at Gateway ICT Solutions and that was when the journey began. Thanks to him and the company for trusting and giving me this opportunity. As I'm writing this, it has been almost 6 months in the job and I have got to know many nice people and learned a lot. The team is quite supportive and I'm enjoying my work. I'm looking forward to working with them for a long time.",

We received the certification after 3 months of intense learning. Honestly, it was an intense 3 months of bootcamp which included many assignments but we also had fun activities and social committe which made the environment much more nicer.

It was quite competitive to get accpeted since there were more than 400 applicants but only 22 students made it. You must have run into 4 different phases about filling application, coding, mindset and interviewing. Before joing the bootcamp I had no idea about how to communicate properly with people around me, especially when it comes to programming. Now I feel that I'm getting better and feel more comfortable working in a team.",

    "content": "I really wanted to code and learn programming. At first, I was at Medical Laboratory College but I didn't like it. Honestly it was one of the hardest decision that I made because I spent a whole year in Medical Laboratory College and I needed to switch to Software Engineering department. Everyone tried to convince me to stay at MLT department but I always had that passion for SE department and learn to code. So I started to switch to SE department and learn programming in June, 2020 with so much passion and excitement even though I had no prior experience. First I tried to learn PHP without knowning why and what I can do with it. I spent a few weeks to months on PHP but then I found freeCodeCamp, basically freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization where you can learn to code for free. I started with HTML, CSS and JavaScript course in fCC. This was when my journey started and began to fall in love with programming. Now I know some technologies such as JavaScript, Reactjs, Nextjs and Firebase. I'm really glad that I chose this field and always looking forward to learn more.",
