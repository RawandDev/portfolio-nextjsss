    "content": "Re:Coded React Bootcamp was a game changer for me. I applied for this bootcamp not only for coding but mostly for networking and knowing how to communicate efficiently. When I applied there was more than 400 applicants which made it really competitive to get accepted. You must have run into 4 different phases about filling application, coding, mindset and interviewing. Before joing the bootcamp I had no idea about how to communicate properly with people around me, especially when it comes to programming. Now I feel that I'm getting better and feel more comfortable working in a team. Honestly, it was an intense 3 months of bootcamp which included many assignments but we also had funny activities and social committe which made the environment much more nicer. I'm really glad that I found Re:Coded and got to know such amazing people with diffrient ideas.",

    "date": "1st June, 2020",
    "content": "I really wanted to code and learn programming. At first, I was at Medical Laboratory College but I didn't like it. Honestly it was one of the hardest decision that I made because I spent a whole year in Medical Laboratory College and I needed to switch to SE department. Everyone tried to convince me to stay at MLT department but I always had that passion for SE department and learn to code. So I started to switch to SE department and learn programming in June, 2020 with so much passion and excitement even though I had no prior experience. First I tried to learn PHP without knowning why and what I can do with it. I spend a few weeks to months but then I switched to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This was when my journey started and began to fall in love with programming. Now I know some technologies such as JavaScript, Reactjs, Nextjs and Firebase. I'm really glad that I chose this field and always looking forward to learn more.",
